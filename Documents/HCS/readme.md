# Music Authentication System: "Jack White's Playlist Passwordmania"

## Human Centred Security Project - University of Glasgow

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a music-based authentication system inspired by Jack White's ability to identify Beatles songs from just a one-second clip. The system serves as an exploration into personalized, skill-based two-factor authentication methods.

## Online Demo

This project is deployed and available online at:
- Live Demo: https://wanglrebe.github.io/Documents/HCS/index.html
- Project Repository: https://github.com/wanglrebe/wanglrebe.github.io/tree/main/Documents/HCS

## Project Overview

This project implements a web-based authentication system that uses a person's ability to recognize familiar music as a security factor. Users upload songs they know well, and the system challenges them to identify these songs from short audio segments. The prototype includes both music authentication and traditional password authentication for comparison purposes.

## System Requirements

- Modern web browser with HTML5 Audio support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local web server for testing (or you can simply open the files directly in a browser)
- No external dependencies or installations required

## Project Files

- `index.html` - Main entry point and landing page
- `music.html` - Music authentication implementation
- `password.html` - Traditional password authentication for comparison
- `settings.html` - System configuration options
- `results.html` - Results display and feedback collection
- `questionnaire.json` - Survey questions for user feedback

## Running the Application Locally

1. Clone or download all files to a local directory
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. The application can be run directly from the browser without a web server

## Submitting Questionnaire Results

After completing the user study:

1. Fill out the questionnaire on the results page
2. Click the "Save All Feedback" button at the end of the questionnaire
3. Use either the "Copy Results" or "Download Results" button to obtain your results data
4. Send the copied or downloaded results to our group members via email or other communication channels

Thank you for participating in our human-centered security research!
